This code demonstrates a common error in C: attempting to free memory allocated on the stack using free.  The variable x is allocated on the stack, and ptr points to it.  Calling free(ptr) results in undefined behavior, and likely memory corruption or a program crash.  This is because free is only for memory allocated dynamically from the heap using malloc, calloc, or similar functions.  Attempting to free stack-allocated memory can lead to unpredictable consequences.
